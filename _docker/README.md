# 🐋 Docker

This folder contains files to build a Docker package for the software. Before starting a new build, make sure to copy the source code into the "_source" folder, and **do not overwrite** the `settings.php` file. There are `.bat` and `.sh` files available to help you build the software. Be sure to update the version and image name in the `docker-compose` file before initiating the build process.

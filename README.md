With flexible permission controls, administrators can assign specific access rights to groups and individual users, ensuring secure and streamlined management of user privileges across the platform.

### üíæ File Management

Provides comprehensive tools for uploading, organizing, and managing media assets efficiently within the platform. This ensures an orderly, accessible, and well-structured file system, enabling users to quickly find, categorize, and maintain digital content. With support for metadata tagging, folder organization, and advanced search capabilities, the system helps streamline media workflows and improves overall asset management productivity.

### üè∑Ô∏è Page Manager

It provides robust features for CMS design, item processing, and site management, enabling teams to efficiently organize and maintain complex digital environments with flexibility and control.

### üß© Extendability

The software includes a built-in store system that allows users to download and deploy modules directly from within the platform. These modules can significantly alter and customize the entire CMS environment, offering powerful flexibility. By default, end users access the integrated store, but developers have the option to configure the system to connect to their own custom stores for deploying proprietary or third-party extensions. Modules can be installed seamlessly via the website interface or manually by uploading .zip files, providing convenience for standard users and flexibility for advanced developers alike.

### ü§ñ AI Integration

Suitefish supports integration with various API endpoints, including OpenAI, allowing seamless interaction with AI models embedded within your projects. The platform includes a comprehensive system for creating AI Agents, which can be assigned to users or managed directly by users themselves for personalized AI-driven chats and interactions. Additionally, Suitefish offers support for Vision AI and image generation, enabling advanced multimedia capabilities within your applications.

### üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Multi-Language Support

This project supports multiple languages, including German, English, Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Hindi, Portuguese, Korean, and Turkish. You can add new languages or modify existing text on the website by overriding translations.

### üñ•Ô∏è Integrated Installer 

The installation process is simplified through a clear and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), making setup quick and accessible for users with minimal technical experience. Additionally, advanced users can choose from alternative installation methods such as Docker containers or automated scripts, providing flexible deployment options to suit different environments and preferences.

### üîÑ Integrated Updater

The software offers a user-friendly GUI-based updater tool that simplifies CMS maintenance by ensuring core components, extension modules, and site modules remain current with minimal user effort. It also supports seamless database updates through integrated update scripts that apply changes progressively based on build numbers, providing a comprehensive and automated system update experience.

### ü™ü Windows Software

The Suitefish Windows application (https://github.com/bugfishtm/suitefish-windows) enables seamless software updating and deployment through the Suitefish web CMS. It allows users to manage, download, and deploy software directly from the Suitefish store within a Windows environment, providing convenient desktop integration and extended management capabilities tailored specifically for Windows users.

### üêõ Developer Friendly

The software offers centralized multi-site management and integrates with Bugfish Framework for bug tracking and debugging with CSS, JavaScript, and PHP support. It includes powerful debugging tools for error detection and performance testing.

## üóíÔ∏è Requirements 

Below are the requirements for both server (root-level) and website installation methods.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Website Mode

Website mode runs Suitefish as a standard site without needing root access, ideal for shared or typical web hosting. It‚Äôs easy to deploy on most hosts, offering a simple installation and management experience using default hosting features.

For detailed server requirements and installation methods see the installation documentation at: [https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/mode_website.html](https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/mode_website.html).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Server Mode

Root-level installation sets up the CMS as a server backend with full control, ideal for managing servers and running advanced services. This requires a dedicated root or virtual server and unlocks system-level features for deeper integration.

For detailed server requirements and installation methods see the installation documentation at: [https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/mode_server.html](https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/mode_server.html).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation 

You can see detailed information at the installation documentation page at: [https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/installation.html](https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/installation.html).

You can install the CMS in two ways: Root-Level Installation (Server-Mode) gives you full server control and access to advanced features, but requires a dedicated VPS or root server. Website Mode runs the CMS as a standard website, making it easy to deploy on shared or managed hosting without root access. Choose the method that best fits your hosting environment and needs.
 
 The initial user account created for the website during installation serves as the primary administrator. This account has full access to configure and manage the system. It is important to secure this account by updating its credentials promptly after installation to protect the site from unauthorized access. 
 
üßç **Initial username:** admin@admin.local  
üîë **Initial password:** changeme  

Consider setting up additional user accounts with appropriate roles and permissions to ensure proper administration and security management going forward.

### ‚úã Manual

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is highly recommended to change the superuser password immediately after installation.

Installing the CMS is straightforward, whether you choose root-level (server-mode) access mode or the default website mode. For detailed instructions on manual installation, please refer to the documentation located in the index.html file within the repository's docs folder, or visit https://bugfishtm.github.io/suitefish-cms/installation_manual.html.

### üê≥ Docker

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is highly recommended to change the superuser password immediately after installation.

This method installs the standard version of Suitefish-CMS, providing full website functionality (website-mode). Please note that the Docker setup runs in a containerized environment, so it does not grant deep system or root-level access required for advanced system authority operations. This ensures a secure and isolated installation suitable for most web use cases. For Docker installation, visit: https://hub.docker.com/r/bugfishtm/suitefish.

### üìÑ Script

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is highly recommended to change the superuser password immediately after installation.

This script is intended for use only on freshly installed servers. In the github repository's `_scripts` folder, you'll find an installation script designed to install the full version with all features on a dedicated server.  Execute the following Commands and navigate through the installation shell process to install suitefish-cms on a fresh server with full root-level access in server-mode.

```bash
curl -o ./installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bugfishtm/suitefish-cms/refs/heads/main/_scripts/installer.sh
chmod u+x ./installer.sh  
sh ./installer.sh install
```

This script is intended for users who wish to utilize advanced functionality on a fresh system.
